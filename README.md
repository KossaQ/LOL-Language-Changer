# How to start

Hello everyone. As it is well known, the languages in League of Legends are limited depending on the region in which we play. This is supposed to change this season, but so far it has not been implemented yet. I have created a program that will allow you to change the language regardless of the region in which you play. The language is changed completely, including the subtitles in the client and the voice of the character. The operation is explained on github. Maybe someone will find it useful.

The zip file contains all the components needed to work. Other files are exactly the same as in the archive.

To use LOL Language Changer you first need to find the path to the LeagueClient.exe file which is in your league of legends folder. The base path is contained in the path file, but it may differ from your path. To change it, click the reset button and search for LeagueClient.exe. Then select a language from the list. if everything went according to plan, the Open League Of Legends button will appear. Click it and enjoy the changed language.

IMPORTANT:

-Once you have chosen the path to the file, you don't have to do it every time. After clicking Select Path, the program will automatically download it from the path.txt.

-For the first time after changing the language, you always have to start the program via a button or a created shortcut. Every time after that, the starting method 
doesn't matter.

-If the path.txt file is deleted, the program will stop working. To fix this, just create it manually.

-The code of the entire program is contained in the file with the .py extension. Feel free to modify it however you like.
